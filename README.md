# Background: 
  MatsumyInCanalu, is a repo for the development of a casual game named "Matsumy In Canalu". This Project was made as an intro project during my undergaraduate career.
  
  The objective of the game was to provide an introduction to 2D game development by using Unity(a video game software development platform).
  
  The Executable file ("cs583S20_Jaimes_Linette_Pro_02.exe") is under the BuiltGgame directory.

--> More Information about the game can be found in the Game Design Document ( file named: Matsumy In Canalu Final GDD ), under the GDD directory.
